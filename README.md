CAMAV - a customized multiple anti-virus scanner



Camav is a custom automated multiple anti-virus solution. Camav implements a custom made multiple anti-virus solution that has the advantage of offering a fast overview of the malware detection while at the same time avoiding the risks related to the use of public services.

Camav is an internal, controllable and scalable alternative to the available public services. This means that it can be implemented in-house and can be controlled by the entity willing to use it and can be easily expanded. Moreover it can be fully controlled due to the configuration files available. Those willing to use it can customize the code so that it is adjusted to the needs and particularities of their environment. Camav, as it is fully customisable, allows the use of any anti-virus program, as long as the anti-virus has a command line interface for scanning. Therefore, an entity willing to use Camav, could select from the numerous anti-virus scanners available on the market.

Camav is an open-source project.
